Produce a [stem plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.stem.html) of the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution $\\operatorname{NB}(r, p)$ (see [scipy.stats.nbinom](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.nbinom.html)) for $r=2$, $p=0.4$. Use `np.arange(30)` for the horizontal axis.\n",

        "  Write a function `sample_from_nb` (see below) that returns a sample of size $n$ drawn from $\\operatorname{NB}(r, p)$ using the above generative process. Half points for correct solutions using a `for` loop. (Obviously, you may not use `scipy.stats.nbinom.rvs` for this problem.)\n",

The data refer to 10 army corps, each observed for 20 years. in 109 corps-years of exposure, there were no deaths, in 65 corps-years, there was one death, and so on.
