## Instructions - Read this first!

This is an individual homework assignment. This means that:

- You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.
- Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.
- You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course.
- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).

If any of these rules seem ambiguous, please check with with your instructor for help interpreting them.

We suggest completing this assignment using the provided notebook. Each question should be answered using a SQL query (or combination or SQL queries) unless the text indicates that you may (or should) do something else. You may submit your queries embedded in Python, using SQLAlchemy or the MySQL Connector, or as plain text in Markdown.

## When you submit your work

Your submission will be graded manually. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, please follow these instructions to prepare your notebook for submission to the D2L Dropbox for Assignment 3:

- Please remove any print statments used to test your work (you can comment them out)
- Please provide your solutions where asked; please do not alter any other parts of this notebook.
- If you need to add cells to test your code please move them to the end of the notebook before submission- or you may included your commented out answers and tests in the cells provided

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will continue to practice and extend your SQL skills, and compare your work to MongoDB.

We will be using two datasets from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. 

 * `earlyOn_info_geom4326.csv` lists locations participating in Ontario's EarlyON program. You can find out more about this dataset from the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/earlyon-child-and-family-centres/)
 * `tdsb_info_geom4326.csv` lists all locations of schools that are operated by the Toronto District School Board. You can find out more about this dataset from the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-district-school-board-locations/).
One dataset lists the locations participating in Ontario's EarlyON program.  

For those who are interested, both CSVs use the WGS84 projection for their location data.

Both datasets are licensed under the [Open Government License - Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/open-data-license/).

You may want to look up both EarlyON and the Toronto District School Board, to acquire more context for this assignment.

## Data cleaning and import

First, import the two CSVs () into your own database. You may use what is available to you on `datasciencedb` or `datasciencedb2`. You may also create indexes and define keys if appropriate for the column(s) of your choice.

In the section below, you have the option to discuss any data cleaning and wrangling steps performed during this process. This is not a requirement and will not be assessed directly for grading; however, this may help to clarify to your reader exactly what was done, to make your work below more understandable.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy as sq

# read in CSV as a dataframe
earlyON_forupload = pd.read_csv('earlyON_info_geom4326.csv')
tdsb_forupload = pd.read_csv('tdsb_info_geom4326.csv')

# connect to database
engine = sq.create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://gavinthomas_hurd:9zyd5IPmI7NOf@datasciencedb.ucalgary.ca/gavinthomas_hurd')

# write dataframe into a table
earlyON_forupload.to_sql("earlyon", engine, index=False, if_exists='replace')
tdsb_forupload.to_sql("tdsb", engine, index=False, if_exists='replace')

# test import success
earlyON_df = pd.read_sql_table("earlyon", engine)
tdsb_df = pd.read_sql_table("tdsb", engine)
# and print some information (not the entire table) about your second dataframe
display(earlyON_df.head())
display(tdsb_df.head())

from sqlalchemy import sql
conn = engine.connect()
```

## Part A: Warm-up Questions (10 marks)

Answer the questions below, including any queries you used where necessary. Not all questions will necessarily require a SQL query for a correct response. You may wish to use as a source the references which are already provided as part of this notebook.

First, let's look at the Toronto District School Board Data.

1. How many schools are included in this file? **(1 mark)**

2.  While not all columns are equally interesting, let's focus on a few columns. Name three columns which could be used as a primary key for this dataset. **(3 marks)**

 
3. How would you describe the difference between the CITY and the MUNICIPALITY column? (Hint: You may wish to use information [at this link](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/access-city-information-or-records/city-of-toronto-archives/using-the-archives/research-by-topic/resources-on-former-municipalities/) as a starting point **(2 marks)**

```python
#1. Number of schools

output = conn.execute(sql.text(''' -- sql 
                               SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sch_name) FROM tdsb 
                               WHERE sch_name IS NOT NULL;
                               '''))
print(output.fetchall())

#585 unique schools
```

    [(585,)]
    

1. Based on the above SQL query, there are 585 distinct schools in the file.
2. As there are the same number of records in the dataset as their are unique schools, we each entry in the dataset cooresponds to a distinct school. Based on this finding, the school name (*sch_name*), address (*ADDRESS_FULL*), and municipality (*MUNICIPALITY*) could serve as a primary key.
3. It appears that the *CITY* column refers to the same geospatial locations as the *MUNICIPALITY* column, but the former contains the areas name prior to their conversion into a municipality of the Greater Toronto Area.

Next, let's look at the EarlyON table. 

4. How many different programs in total are listed in this dataset? **(1 mark)**

5. Are there any programs without websites listed? **(1 mark)**

6. Which columns would be suitable primary keys for this table? **(1 mark)**

7. Which major_intersection is listed for the most programs (and is not null)? Include the name of the intersection with the number of services. **(1 mark)**

```python
#4. Number of programs
output = conn.execute(sql.text(''' -- sql 
                               SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT program_name) FROM earlyon 
                               WHERE program_name IS NOT NULL;
                               '''))
print(output.fetchall())

#253 unique programs

#5. Programs without website
output = conn.execute(sql.text(''' -- sql 
                               SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT program_name) FROM earlyon 
                               WHERE website IS NULL;
                               '''))
print(output.fetchall())
#68 programs without website

#7. Major intersection associated with most programs
output = conn.execute(sql.text(''' -- sql 
select major_intersection, COUNT(program_name)
from earlyon
group by major_intersection
order by COUNT(program_name) desc
LIMIT 2;
                               ;
                               '''))
print(output.fetchall())
#King St W/shaw St appears to be the most common non-null major intersection, 
# #although with a count of 1 it is likley tied with all other non-null intersections.
```

    [(253,)]
    [(68,)]
    [(None, 219), ('King St W/shaw St', 1)]
    

4. Based upon the above query, there are 253 unique programs in the dataset.
5. There appears to be 68 programs that do not have an associated website.
6. The program names (*program_name*) column appear to be a good candidate as a primary key, however there are more records than unique values (as seen in q4). Therefore the *program_name* column might best be used in combination with the *_id* field to act as a primary key. Latly, the *address* in combination with the *_id* field could also be used as a primary key.
7. From the final SQL query result (above) we see that the *major_intersection* value that is associated with the most programs is actually *NULL*. The greatest non-null value is *King St W/shaw St*, however it only has a value of 1 and therefore is likley tied with many other major intersections.

## Part B: SQL with multiple tables (13 marks)

How many French-language EarlyON programs are currently operating in schools, and in what municipalities? **(2 marks)**

Provide a breakdown of schools offering EarlyON programs, by school type (for example, elementary, or secondary). include the ID for both the EarlyON program and the school.  **(2 marks)**

List all schools offering EarlyON programs which do not belong to the Toronto District School Board. **(1 mark)**

List all schools belonging to the Toronto District School Board which do not offer EarlyON programs **(1 mark)**

Out of all programs offered, what percentage of programTypes (Drop-in, Registered, Virtual) are offered by the EarlyON programs? Does this differ for programs housed in TDSB schools, compared to those which are not? **(2 marks)**

Prepare a list of community information in a single table, as follows: **(5 marks)**
- All EarlyOn programs should be listed, using the name of the program, and the full address.
- Where an EarlyON is hosted at a TDSB school, include the municipality, place name, and whether the school is an elementary school or secondary school.
- Any TDSB school that does not host an EarlyON program should be listed, using the address, municipality and place name.

```python
#How many French-language EarlyON programs are currently operating in schools, and in what municipalities? 

output = conn.execute(sql.text(''' -- sql 
SELECT t.municipality, e.address FROM
(select french_language_program, `address`
from earlyon
WHERE french_language_program = 'Yes') as e
inner join
(select municipality, 'address'
FROM tdsb) as t
ON e.address = t.address;
                               '''))
print(output.fetchall())
#3 french language programs, none are operating in schools
```

## Part C: Evaluating your results  (7 marks)

**Question 1 (2 marks)**

The two datasets provided for this assignment offer a limited set of data, for different purposes. How do you think the use of these datasets might differ?

The tdsb dataset appears to be a repository of school locations and their attributes. This would be useful in geopsatial analyses such as the distribution of school densities/accessibility by region in the GTA. On the other hand, the EarlyON dataset contains information about the time and location of various community programs; such a dataset would be more geared towards developing a public-use application about when and where to access community services.

**Question 2 (1 mark)**

One thing you may have had consider is your selection of columns from both datasets to use as a key for any joins you performed. Discuss your reasoning behind your choice of key. If you don't think you had a reason in particular, then name another pair of colums which could have been used to execute your joins.

The choice of primary key for joins was often determined by the question itself. In several instances, the goal was to obtain information from the tdsb dataset for all instances where the school was common to the EarlyON dataset. For these cases, it made sense to structure the query on the school_name attribute such that the join itself would filter the tdsb dataset to the desired subset. After this, the relevant information could easily be extracted from the subset/joined dataset.

**Question 3 (4 marks)**

It is possible to download both datasets as GeoJSON files rather than as CSVs. Imagine that we have loaded these GeoJSON files into MongoDB instead of a relational database.

Pick one of the queries from Part B to discuss. Do you think it is more difficult to retrieve the information requested for this query from the pair of relational database tables provided to you, or from a MongoDB collection set up as described? Explain why or why not. 

For the final question in Part b that asked: *"Prepare a list of community information in a single table..."*, I imagine that parts of it are well suited towards a GeoJSON/MongoDB collection, while other aspects are not. The key:value format of a JSON based query would allow the efficient extraction and combination of the schools in the tdsb collection that offer earlyON programs. However, I am less confident in MongoDB's ability to create the new category of *class* (e.g. elementary or secondary) across different levels in the hierarchy. Additionally, I am not sure if MongoDB would be able to effectively populate missing data points for attributes that are not shared in part of the query (i.e. the NAs in the program_name column for tdsb schools that did not host EarlyON programs).
Unfortunately, much of the above is based solely on my admitedly vague understanding of MongoDB. I do plan on broadening my DBMS competency with experrience in MongoDB, but for the time being I think it is wise to assume that my understanding of MongoDB is limited.

## Part E: Reflection (5 marks)

In a brief paragraph for each (no more than 500 words total), answer the following:

1) Identify a skill or concept which you are now more knowledgable or comfortable with now, compared to at the start of DATA 604. 

2) What best helped you to learn this skill or concept? Was it something covered in class, part of an assignment or project, or another resource?

3) Based upon what you have learned, where do you see an opportunity to continue to develop your understanding of this skill? 

1. Following the past few months, my abilities in SQL syntax and knowledge of Databses has grown enormously. At the start of this course I could not have confidently said what the advantages of a designated databse were. Now I understand the invaluable speed and security benefits provided by databsase management systems, and I could even set up a very basic one. Additionally, I can confidently perform basic SQL queries, and I believe I have the tools to learn how to structure complex queries.
2. For me, nothing can beat hands-on experience. I found the assignments and the projects to be the best way to further my understanding of working with 'big data.' As a side not, I may actually have learned the most when things went wrong. For example, when the UofC db server crashed, I created a local server which was a great learning opportunity. Similarly, during the project when I tried to join tables based on geospatial attributed and the computation time proved to be too much, I learned how to more efficiently structure *joins* by joining at two different levels of specificity, and consequently decreasing the 'Big O.'
3. As mentioned in the above question, I have limited experience with other DBMS. For me, obtianing hands-on experience with MongoDB and other systems would be hugely beneficial. This would be best done through a project, which might mean that it would be good for me to find a way to complete an upcoming project in the MDSA program through the use of a different DBMS.
