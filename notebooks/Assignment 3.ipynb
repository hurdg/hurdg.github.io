    "This is an individual homework assignment. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.\n",
    "- Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.\n",
    "- You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course.\n",
    "- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).\n",

    "We suggest completing this assignment using the provided notebook. Each question should be answered using a SQL query (or combination or SQL queries) unless the text indicates that you may (or should) do something else. You may submit your queries embedded in Python, using SQLAlchemy or the MySQL Connector, or as plain text in Markdown.\n",

Therefore the *program_name* column might best be used in combination with the *_id* field to act as a primary key. Latly, the *address* in combination with the *_id* field could also be used as a primary key.\n",

The greatest non-null value is *King St W/shaw St*, however it only has a value of 1 and therefore is likley tied with many other major intersections."

    "For the final question in Part b that asked: *\"Prepare a list of community information in a single table...\"*, I imagine that parts of it are well suited towards a GeoJSON/MongoDB collection, while other aspects are not. The key:value format of a JSON based query would allow the efficient extraction and combination of the schools in the tdsb collection that offer earlyON programs. However, I am less confident in MongoDB's ability to create the new category of *class* (e.g. elementary or secondary) across different levels in the hierarchy. Additionally, I am not sure if MongoDB would be able to effectively populate missing data points for attributes that are not shared in part of the query (i.e. the NAs in the program_name column for tdsb schools that did not host EarlyON programs).\n",

At the start of this course I could not have confidently said what the advantages of a designated databse were. Now I understand the invaluable speed and security benefits provided by databsase management systems, and I could even set up a very basic one. Additionally, I can confidently perform basic SQL queries, and I believe I have the tools to learn how to structure complex queries.\n",
    "2. For me, nothing can beat hands-on experience. I found the assignments and the projects to be the best way to further my understanding of working with 'big data.' As a side not, I may actually have learned the most when things went wrong. For example, when the UofC db server crashed, I created a local server which was a great learning opportunity. Similarly, during the project when I tried to join tables based on geospatial attributed and the computation time proved to be too much, I learned how to more efficiently structure *joins* by joining at two different levels of specificity, and consequently decreasing the 'Big O.'\n",
